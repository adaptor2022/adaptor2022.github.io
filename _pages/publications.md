Participants will firstly submit a 'half-page write up' of the challenge explaining their approach (together with the docker container submission). Additionally, the participants have the option to submit an '8-page paper' on their methods, adhering to the same schedule of the <a href="https://dgm4miccai.github.io/">DGM4MICCAI workshop</a>. The paper will be published in Springer's LNCS „Deep Generative Model“ workshop
proceedings after review. This paper should include details of their methods and initial results produced on their **own split of the training data**. CMT will be used for submission. The participants must choose the AdaptOR Challenge option under "Subject Areas", while creating a submission in the CMT platform. There are no restrictions on the number of authors. 

After the challenge, the challenge organizers will publish one challenge journal paper together with two
participants of each challenge team summarizing the results. Each team should nominate two authors (typically it
is the first and last author). An embargo period until the availability of this journal paper will be defined.
