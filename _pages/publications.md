Additionally, the participants have the option to submit an '8-page paper' on their methods, adhering to the same schedule of the <a href="https://dgm4miccai.github.io/">DGM4MICCAI workshop</a>. The paper will be published in Springer's LNCS. 

After the challenge is concluded, a 'journal paper' (preferable TMI or MedIA) will be submitted to summarize the challenge results. First
