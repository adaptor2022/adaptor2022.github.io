Participants will firstly submit a 'half-page write up' of the challenge explaining their approach (together with the docker container submission). Additionally, the participants have the option to submit an '8-page paper' on their methods, adhering to the same schedule of the <a href="https://dgm4miccai.github.io/">DGM4MICCAI workshop</a>. The paper will be published in Springer's LNCS „Deep Generative Model“ workshop
proceedings after the workshop. There are no restrictions on the number of authors.

After the challenge, the challenge organizers will publish one challenge journal paper together with two
participants of each challenge team summarizing the results. Each team should nominate two authors (typically it
is the first and last author). An embargo period until the availability of this journal paper will be defined.
